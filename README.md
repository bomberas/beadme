__Description:__
Multiplayer board game fully developed in Java.

<b>Game\'s Mechanic</b>
<p>The game involves two to four players, the number of players can be selected in the settings section (by default the game will start with 2 players), each player can select a character and place 5 of these on the board. This board is a square grid of 7x7 with 14 sliding bars, 7 placed vertically and 7 horizontally, plus each bar has 9 slots, each of which is either holed or filled.</p>

<b>How to play?</b>
<p>Each player places the beads of his/her own character over the grid's holes in turns (in a robin fashion way). Of course it's not possible place two beads in the same hole nor place a bead over a not covered hole. The player then slides a bar by a single position, some beads may "fall down" and disappear from the game. The goal is to eliminate as many opponents' beads as possible without eliminating one's own beads (that's suicide!!!). When a player loses all his/her beads, the player is out of the game.</p>

<b>One more thing!</b>
<p>You can't slide a bar that was slid in the previous turn by anyone of your opponents, sorry but RULES are RULES, and when only two players are left, you cannot slide the same bar for more than two consecutive turns. If the remaining beads belong to different players, and they all fall down at the same time, the player sliding the bar wins.</p>

<b>And that\'s all folks!</b>
