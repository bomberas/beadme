    <string name="help_intro_title">Why should I play this?</string>
    <string name="help_intro_pink">Little mermaid A.K.A Megi, a clown, santa and even our little red devil are super excited to be part of this game,
        what they don\'t know (but you will if you just keep reading this wonderful tutorial) is that just one single move could be THE end.\n\nSorry but
        not sorry! You have to be smart, there is no zombies in this game, so don\'t commit suicide.
    </string>
    <string name="help_intro_expelliarmus">Harry, Hermione, Snape and even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named will appreciate your help, all of them are hanging on
        broomsticks, praying to not fall down so be careful and smart! (unless you want to meet with Sirius) or just a move of these brand new Nimbus 2000
        (I know, 15 years later right? We\'re short on budget &#8230;) could be as lethal as an Avada kedavra!!!
    </string>
    <string name="help_intro_chewbacca">Help Han Solo, Chew, the stormtroopers and even Darth Vader in this war of stars (copyright right? let\'s all embrace
        the power of the dark side).\n\nAll of them are praying to not be killed and be part of the sequel, we all know about Darth Vader so be careful! don\'t
        push your luck, no one can survive a light saber stab, not even Han Solo!!!
    </string>
    <string name="help_first_title">Game\'s Mechanic</string>
    <string name="help_first_desc">The game involves two to four players, the number of players can be selected in the
        settings section (by default the game will start with 2 players), each player can select a character and place 5 of these on the board.
        \n\nThis board is a square grid of 7x7 with 14 sliding bars, 7 placed vertically and 7 horizontally, plus each bar has 9 slots, each of which is
        either holed or filled.
    </string>
    <string name="help_second_title">How to play?</string>
    <string name="help_second_desc">Each player places the beads of his/her own character over the grid\'s holes in turns (in a robin fashion way). Of course it\'s
        not possible place two beads in the same hole nor place a bead over a not covered hole.\n\nThe player then slides a bar by a single position,
        some beads may \"fall down\" and disappear from the game. The goal is to eliminate as many opponents\' beads as
        possible without eliminating one\'s own beads (that\'s suicide!!!). When a player loses all his/her beads, the player is out of the game.
    </string>
    <string name="help_third_title">One more thing!</string>
    <string name="help_third_desc">You can\'t slide a bar that was slid in the previous turn by anyone of your opponents, sorry but RULES are RULES,
        and when only two players are left, you cannot slide the same bar for more than two consecutive turns.\n\nIf the remaining beads belong to different players,
        and they all fall down at the same time, the player sliding the bar wins. And that\'s all folks!
