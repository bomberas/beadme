        (I know, 15 years later right? We\'re short on budget &#8230;) could be as lethal as an Avada kedavra!!!</b>

    <string name="help_first_desc"><b>The game involves two to four players, the number of players can be selected in the
        settings section (by default the game will start with 2 players), each player can select a character and place 5 of these on the board.
        \n\nThis board is a square grid of 7x7 with 14 sliding bars, 7 placed vertically and 7 horizontally, plus each bar has 9 slots, each of which is
        either holed or filled.</b>

    <string name="help_second_title"><b>How to play?</b></string>
    <string name="help_second_desc"><b>Each player places the beads of his/her own character over the grid\'s holes in turns (in a robin fashion way). Of course it\'s
        not possible place two beads in the same hole nor place a bead over a not covered hole.\n\nThe player then slides a bar by a single position,
        some beads may \"fall down\" and disappear from the game. The goal is to eliminate as many opponents\' beads as
        possible without eliminating one\'s own beads (that\'s suicide!!!). When a player loses all his/her beads, the player is out of the game.</b>
